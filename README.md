# Final Project

This repository contains a multi-platform app (Expo/React Native + web) located in the `apps/` folder.

Structure:
- `apps/mobile` — React Native / Expo app
- `apps/web` — web app and build tools

See each app's `README.md` inside `apps/*` for app-specific setup.

Quick local steps:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn`
2. Run mobile: `cd apps/mobile && expo start`
3. Run web: `cd apps/web && npm run dev`

Do NOT commit secrets or `.env` files.
